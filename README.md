### Hello! My name is Pipa and I am student at George Mason Univerity in Virgina. In this Github Repository you will find that I have used my skills that were acquired in my History Of IT 360 class. The main project in this repository is a Twine story that is focused on the 6 wives of King Henry. It also includes the fun song "Divorced, Beheaded, Died... Divorced, Beheaded, Survived".

If you would like to learn more about me here is the link to my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/madison-pipa-a0141523a/
